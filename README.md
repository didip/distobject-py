---

**distobject-py** is a lightweight Python library to create **distributed objects** backed by **Redis HashMaps** and **Redis Pub/Sub** for real-time synchronization.

Objects are automatically persisted and changes are broadcasted across instances — enabling scalable, consistent state sharing between systems.

---

## Project Status

> This project is **complete**.

All source code was **generated by AI (ChatGPT)**,  
with **project ideas, design direction, and corrections provided by me**.

It serves as a demonstration of **how far AI can assist in building real, usable software** under human guidance with very minimal interference.

---

## Features

- **Distributed Object Storage** via Redis HashMaps
- **Real-Time Notifications** with Redis Pub/Sub
- **Simple Decorator API**: Just add `@distobject`
- **ULID-Based IDs** for unique and sortable object identifiers
- **Customizable** Redis connection, prefixes, and channels
- **Easy Save/Load** methods injected automatically
- **Pytest-Tested** with CI/CD integration

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install distobject-py
```

Coming soon to PyPI

## Quick Start Example

```
import redis
from distobject import distobject

# Initialize your Redis client
r = redis.Redis()

# Create a distributed object
@distobject(redis_client=r)
class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

# Create and save a new user
user = User(name="Alice")
user.save()

# Later, load the user from Redis
loaded_user = User.load(user.get_id())
print(loaded_user.name)  # Output: "Alice"
```

## How It Works

* When you call .save(), the object's attributes are saved into a Redis HashMap.

* A Redis Pub/Sub message is sent on a channel when an object is updated.

* You can listen to updates using standard Redis subscriptions.

* IDs are automatically assigned using ULID.

## Development Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/didip/distobject-py.git
cd distobject-py
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest tests/

# with Docker Compose
docker compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from test-runner
```
